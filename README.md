# ElevateLabs_Task8
ðŸ“Š SQL Developer Internship â€“ Task 8: Stored Procedures and Functions
ðŸš€ Objective

Learn reusable SQL blocks using CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION to modularize SQL logic.

ðŸ›  Tools Used

DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench

MySQL 8.0 syntax for procedures/functions

ðŸ“Œ What I Did

âœ… Created a Stored Procedure (AddEmployee) to insert employee records dynamically using IN parameters.
âœ… Created a Function (CalculateAnnualSalary) to calculate annual salary from monthly salary, demonstrating return values.
âœ… Used parameterized, reusable SQL to understand how modular blocks can simplify repeated logic.
âœ… Tested by inserting data and retrieving data using the function for inline calculations.
